# JSON to TypeScript Interface Generator

This project provides a utility function to generate TypeScript interfaces from a given JSON object. The generated interface is fully structured to handle deep nesting, mixed data types, and arrays, making it a perfect tool for developers working with TypeScript in projects where type safety and structure are crucial.

## Features

- **Deep Nesting Support:** Handles JSON objects with multiple levels of nested objects and arrays.
- **Mixed Data Types:** Automatically detects and handles different data types within arrays.
- **Simple and Clean Output:** Generates a single, well-formatted TypeScript interface, making it easy to copy and paste directly into your project.
